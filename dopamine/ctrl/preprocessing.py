  Specifically, this provides the following subset from the JAIR paper
  (Bellemare et al., 2013) and Nature DQN paper (Mnih et al., 2015):

    * Frame skipping (defaults to 4).
    * Terminal signal when a life is lost (off by default).
    * Grayscale and max-pooling of the last two frames.
    * Downsample the screen to a square image (defaults to 84x84).

  More generally, this class follows the preprocessing guidelines set down in
  Machado et al. (2018), "Revisiting the Arcade Learning Environment:
  Evaluation Protocols and Open Problems for General Agents".
